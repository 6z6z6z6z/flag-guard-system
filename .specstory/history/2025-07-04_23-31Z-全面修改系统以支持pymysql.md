# 全面修改系统以支持PYMYSQL (2025-07-04 23:31Z)

_**User**_

我们的系统之前使用的是SQLAIchemy，需要改成PYMYSQL,数据库使用MYSQL，还要将其中的sql语句提出来建立sql文件。已经改了一些，还有一些没改，比如前面改了users.py但是dashboard.py,events.py,file.py,flag.py,points.py,trainings.py都没有改，麻烦帮我检查代码，全面地彻底地修改代码，使得系统使用MYSQL,不改变现有的功能和界面，不改动其他的功能和界面。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking me to help them convert their system from using SQLAlchemy to PyMySQL for connecting to MySQL database, and to extract SQL queries into separate SQL files. They've already made some changes (like modifying users.py) but need help completing the conversion for the remaining routes files (dashboard.py, events.py, file.py, flag.py, points.py, trainings.py).

Let me first understand how the system is structured currently:
1. The system has a backend and frontend
2. The backend uses Flask (as suggested by app.py, routes folder structure)
3. It was previously using SQLAlchemy but now they want to use PyMySQL directly
4. They already have a models_pymysql.py file which likely contains the PyMySQL implementation

To help with this task, I need to:
1. Examine how the conversion from SQLAlchemy to PyMySQL was done in the already-modified files
2. Check the structure of models_pymysql.py
3. Examine the remaining route files to understand what needs to be converted
4. Make similar changes to the remaining route files
5. Extract SQL queries to separate SQL files

Let me start by examining the already modified files and the PyMySQL implementation to understand the pattern.</details></think>

Let me help you migrate the remaining routes from SQLAlchemy to PyMySQL. I'll first check what changes were already made and then apply similar changes to the remaining route files.

Let me also check the SQL queries file to understand how SQL statements are organized:

---

Read file: backend/sql/queries.py

---

Read file: backend/routes/users.py
