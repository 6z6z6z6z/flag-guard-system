# 检查升降旗记录界面问题 (2025-07-05 01:02Z)

_**User**_

很抱歉，上面升降旗的问题还是没有解决，进入升降旗记录界面就提示Internal server error，而且队员提交记录，界面也不会显示，管理员的界面也不会显示队员所提交的记录，无法审核。麻烦帮我检查代码，全面地彻底地修改代码，不改变现有的功能和界面，不改动其他的功能和界面。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is reporting an issue with a flag management system. They're experiencing "Internal server error" when accessing the flag records interface. Additionally, team members can't see submitted records, and administrators can't see or review the records submitted by team members. The user wants me to check the code, thoroughly modify it to fix these issues, but without changing the existing functionality and UI.

Based on the file structure, this appears to be a web application with:
1. A Python backend (likely Flask-based given the structure)
2. A Vue.js frontend

I need to:
1. Examine the backend routes/flag.py - this likely contains the API endpoints for flag-related operations
2. Check frontend/src/views/FlagRecords.vue and FlagReview.vue - these appear to be the relevant frontend views
3. Look at any models or database-related code that handles flag records
4. Investigate any API calls or data fetching in the frontend related to flag records

Let me start by examining these files to diagnose the issue.</details></think>

让我检查一下升降旗记录功能中的问题。首先，我需要查看相关的后端代码和前端视图。

---

Read file: backend/routes/flag.py

---

让我查看前端的代码来了解展示逻辑：

---

Read file: frontend/src/views/FlagRecords.vue

---

Read file: frontend/src/views/FlagRecords.vue

---

Read file: frontend/src/views/FlagReview.vue
