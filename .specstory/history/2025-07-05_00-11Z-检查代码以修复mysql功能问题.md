# 检查代码以修复MYSQL功能问题 (2025-07-05 00:11Z)

_**User**_

我们的系统之前使用的是SQLAIchemy，需要改成PYMYSQL,数据库使用MYSQL，还要将其中的sql语句提出来建立sql文件。现在大部分已经修改完成，系统也能够运行，但现在有几个功能出现了问题：1.管理员在用户界面看不到用户的手机号信息；2.用户在活动列表，训练列表，查看报名时，看不到报名人员的信息。麻烦帮我检查代码，全面地彻底地修改代码，使得系统使用MYSQL,不改变现有的功能和界面，不改动其他的功能和界面。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking for help with a system migration from SQLAlchemy to PyMySQL with MySQL as the database. They've already completed most of the migration, but are experiencing two specific issues:

1. Administrators can't see user phone number information in the user interface
2. Users can't see participant information in activity lists, training lists, and registration views

Let's first understand the system structure to identify where these issues might be occurring. I'll need to examine:

1. The models to understand the data structure
2. The routes that handle user information, activities, and trainings
3. The SQL queries that might need fixing

Let's start by looking at the models and database structure to understand the relationships between users, activities, and trainings.

First, let's check the PyMySQL models file:</details></think>

Let me check your codebase to identify and fix the issues with the PyMySQL implementation. I'll focus on the two problems: administrators not seeing user phone numbers and users not seeing participant information in activities and trainings.
