_**User**_

好的，现在活动报名人员信息显示了，但是身高体重鞋码部分没有显示，如图所示，麻烦帮我检查代码，全面地彻底地修改代码，使得系统使用MYSQL,不改变现有的功能和界面，不改动其他的功能和界面。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>This issue seems to be about displaying participant information for an event registration system. According to the screenshot, some information is missing - specifically height (cm), weight (kg), and shoe size are not being displayed properly.

The user is asking me to:
1. Check the code
2. Modify the code to make sure the system uses MySQL
3. Ensure the height, weight, and shoe size are properly displayed
4. Not change any existing functionality and interface

From the project layout, I can see this is a full-stack application with:
- A Flask backend (in `/backend`)
- A Vue.js frontend (in `/frontend`)

The git status shows that there are many modified files, and there are some new files related to MySQL:
- `backend/db_connection.py`
- `backend/models_pymysql.py`
- `backend/models_pymysql_bak.py`
- `backend/sql/`

The branch name is `mysql1`, which suggests they're in the process of migrating to MySQL.

Let me first look at the Vue component that's likely displaying this registration information, which would be in the frontend. Then I'll check the backend APIs that provide this data.

Let me examine the relevant files:
1. First, I need to find the Vue component that displays the registration list (likely in `/frontend/src/views/`)
2. Then check the API routes in the backend (likely in `/backend/routes/`)
3. Finally, check the data models (in `/backend/models*.py`)</details></think>

I'll help you fix this issue with the missing height, weight, and shoe size data in the registration display. Let's examine the relevant code.
